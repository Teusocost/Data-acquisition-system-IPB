# Data-acquisition-system-IPB

This project aims to develop an autonomous data acquisition system based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to monitor sheep and goat grazing in the north-eastern region of Portugal. The system is designed with a focus on the autonomy, reliability and ergonomics of the device, using technologies such as LoRa and GNSS to enable accurate monitoring of the animals during grazing.

# Architecture

An IoT architecture has been developed that contains detection layers, a network layer, a service layer and an interface layer. The codes presented in this repository refer to the "device", the "gateway", the "Node-red" and the "Grafana". the bellow figure shows an overview of the architecture.
